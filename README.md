This git repository holds the code for our scoping of waiting list calculations related to a limited Pilot of Cross Cover system.  

## Aims

To quantify the waiting list, calculate pressures, relief capacity and time to clearance to excess WL down to sustainable number.  
More specifically: 

- We need to get to a point where reducing waiting list with capacity > demand	
-	Demand would reduce under demand management from Crosscover, so estimating 20% further reduction effects on WL
-	Sustainable WL number for 18 week	
-	Average wait at sustainable	number
-	Time to bring the waiting list down	sustainable number
-	What would we need to reduce to 18 weeks, if it takes 12 months to procure and set up, how many years/months to reach target wait?)

**By contributing to this project, you are taking responsibility for not uploading any data to GitHub**

To help with this, the project is contains a `.gitignore` file.  This file contains file/folder/file extensions that Git will ignore by default.  If you need to import one of these files, you can do so, but you will need to use the `force` command to do so.

- If using any data files, load them on your local machine to a folder called '/data/' and verify it is not committed. The .gitignore should do this automatically, but please check.
- Similarly for output, if generating any tables or potentially identifiable data (due to small numbers or record-level tables), add to a folder calle '/output/' and verify it is not committed.  The .gitignore should do this automatically, but please check.
